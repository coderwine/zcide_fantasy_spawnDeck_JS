# Setup
Simply select the decks that you are wanting to include in a session. After you have selected those, click the "Make Deck" button and it will populate a shuffled set of draw cards.

Click on the draw deck to display the first spawn.

**This is intended to view from a mobile device. Styling is currently incomplete.**

# Current Decks
- Black Plague
- Wulfsburg
- Green Horde
  - Need images for:
    - Orc Fatty, Orc Necromancer, Orc Abomination
- No Rest for the Wicked
- Friends and Foes
- Murder of Crows

# Consider
- Include a check to see if a deck has already been included.
  - Allow for duplicate decks?

# WIP
- Supply a count of cards within the deck
- "Reshuffled deck only provides half the deck **bug**.

## v2 Ideas
- Provide an option to remove or add duplicate cards.
  - ie: add/remove abom or necro cards to scale difficulty. 
- % change of have various threats show up posted below the pull deck.
- Include all other types of sets available.
- Note which position the spawns are coming in at
  - ie: which spawn location indicated by a number.
- React App should detail current sessions to indicate spawn locations and what is recommended for play.

# Images needed:
- GH Fatty
- GH Necro
- GH Abom
